# Website Project â€“ AlfaTech Web Hosting Provider

This project was developed from scratch using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, with the goal of simulating the institutional website of a fictional company called **AlfaTech**, specialized in web hosting services.

The main objective was to create a modern, clean, and functional interface, applying core web development concepts with a focus on semantic structure, responsive styling, and smooth user interactions.

## ðŸ“„ Project Structure

The website consists of:

- **2 HTML pages**: `index.html` (main page) and `tabeladeprecos.html` (pricing table)
- **2 CSS files**: One for each page
- **2 JavaScript scripts**:
  - `script1.js`: Adds a fade-in animation as the user scrolls and smooth scrolling when clicking some links.
  - `script2.js`: Adds a fade-in animation on initial page load.

## ðŸ§  Objective

The focus of this project is to practice and consolidate fundamental front-end skills, with special attention to code organization, file structure, and applying subtle effects to make navigation more pleasant.
